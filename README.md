# EvacuationSimforEQ
This is a modified FFCA model for crowd evacuation simulation in earthquake scenarios.
## Platform
MATLAB R2021a
## Description
* Folder 'Codes' includes all codes for the simulation model.
* '01Low-magnitude.avi' is the simulation result of the evacuation under a low-magnitude earthquake.
* '02Medium-magnitude.avi' is the simulation result of the evacuation under a medium-magnitude earthquake.
* '03Large-magnitude.avi' is the simulation result of the evacuation under a large-magnitude earthquake.
